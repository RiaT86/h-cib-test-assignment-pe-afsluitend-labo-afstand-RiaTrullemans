# Game of Thrones: Great Houses

## House Lannister

House Lannister of Casterly Rock is one of the Great Houses of Westeros, one of its richest and most powerful families and one of its oldest dynasties. It was also the royal House of the Seven Kingdoms following the extinction of House Baratheon of King's Landing, which had been their puppet house during the War of the Five Kings, for a brief stint of time until House Targaryen took back the Iron Throne in Daenerys Targaryen's war for Westeros.

## House Greyjoy

House Greyjoy of Pyke is one of the Great Houses of Westeros. It rules over the Iron Islands, a harsh and bleak collection of islands off the west coast of Westeros, from the castle at Pyke. The head of the house is the Lord Reaper of Pyke.
